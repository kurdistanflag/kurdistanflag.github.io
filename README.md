Kurdistan Flag Creator is an app that runs on web browsers without needing any additional download. It allows you create original Kurdistan flag in any size and save it to your computer or mobile phone.

For creative design minds, you can also edit many aspects of the Kurdistan flag like;

* changing color of the Kurdistan flag bands and Kurdish Sun
* changing the orientation of the 3 bands of Kurdistan flag as diagonally or vertically
* editing thickness of the Kurdish Sun rays
* changing the number of the Kurdish Sun rays.

Here are some settings and their documentation to use them:

## Resize

**Width:** You can use this number input box to set the width of the flag in pixels. Because Kurdistan flag has a 3:2 ratio, the width of the flag always has to be 3/2 times bigger than its height to preserve the aspect ratio. As an example, if you set the width of the flag to 900, the height of the flag will automatically update itself to 600 pixels to preserve the correct aspect of the flag.

**Height:** You can use this number input box to set the height of the flag in pixels. Because Kurdistan flag has a 3:2 ratio, the height of the flag always has to be 3/2 times smaller than its width to preserve the aspect ratio. As an example, if you set the height of the flag to 600, the width of the flag will automatically update itself to 900 pixels to preserve the correct aspect of the flag.

## Bands

You can set the color of each Kurdistan flag's bands by using these **3** color pickers. Kurdistan flag's **1st** band has **#ed2024**, **2nd** band has **#ffffff**, **3rd** band has **#278e43** color as default.

## Angles

**Bands:** You can set the direction of the 3 bands of Kurdistan flag by this number box. You can create diagonal and vertical flags by this option. Default value is **0** as Kurdistan flag is horizontal.

**Rays:** This number box will allow you to determine how thick or thin the Kurdish Sun rays will be. The default Sun Ray angle is around **17** degrees for each ray. The lesser the angle the thinner the rays become, and vice versa.
